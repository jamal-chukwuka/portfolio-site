# Jamal Nezianya â€“ Developer Portfolio

This is a dual-framework developer portfolio project, showcasing frontend proficiency in both **React (Vite)** and **Angular**. 

## Project Structure
Each component (About, Projects, Contact) is modular and has its own directory containing the JSX and CSS Module for styling.

## Features

- Modular, reusable React components.
- Clean and modern UI inspired by [briceclain.com](https://briceclain.com/en/).
- Ready to scale with routing, animations, or backend integration.
- Upcoming: Toggle between React and Angular versions.
- Upcoming: Inline display of source code for each section (like exposed brick).

## Philosophy
